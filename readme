// The drush commands
One of the problems working with Git and Features module, 
is when you pulling from git before you update your features changes to code.
Well, now (let's say you got some feature changes coming form the pull) you have to deside, 
revert the feature and ignore all of your settings changes 
or recreate the feature and override someone else's job.
This drush command is tring to help you enforce the very basic procedures of 
"Always UPDATE your feature to code BEFORE you pulling from git (drush fu)"
"Always REVERT your feature from code AFTER the pulling (drush fr)"
by checking the features state before pulling and stop you from continue,
in case one feature has override state.
although if you want to pull knowing not all features are in default state, 
you can use the drush pull force command.
